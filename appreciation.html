<p>Purple and black, two of my favorite colors, serve as the primary visual elements of my website, which shares their names. This lends it a bit of my individuality and reveals my preferences. It is essential to incorporate elements that are consistent with my individual sense of style and preference. Furthermore, I have opted to utilise quotes from Buya Hamka as the title of my work due to his significant influence and personal admiration as an author and public figure.</p>
<p>I have a number of creative options at my disposal that I can use to make the design appear to be more lighthearted and childlike. One of these options is to populate the website in question with a large number of cartoon pictures. I've found that using cartoon drawings on my website can help me attract a younger audience and give it a more humorous tone. They can also help it feel more friendly and inviting.</p>
<p>Concerning the issues I encountered when developing the software, it is common to have difficulty translating conceptual design concepts into operational website components. This may involve locating and inserting the cartoon drawings in the appropriate locations, as well as ensuring that they are optimized for web display and maintaining a uniform appearance.</p>
<p>
During the time that I spent working on my website, I definitely picked up some useful information regarding HTML, CSS, and just plain web design in general. I will be able to put my knowledge of how to organize and style web pages as well as strategies for responsive design to good use in the projects that I will be working on in the future. In addition, I could have realized how significant the user experience is, as well as how to design programs that are aesthetically pleasing and simple to operate.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a sensible method to demonstrate my appreciation for his assistance and wisdom is to send a sincere thank you message to Sir Airul, who was the one who instructed me on this topic. As a web developer student, having a lecturer that is dedicated to their work and knows what they are talking about may be of tremendous assistance to me in terms of my education and professional development.
